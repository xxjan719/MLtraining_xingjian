# Machine Learning Training
This is the project including a training on machine learning algorithms. 
Algorithms are implemented by the `numpy` library and datasets are from `sklearn`.
1. [linear regression](1_linear_regression/README.md)
2. [logistic regression](2_logistic_regression/README.md)
3. [K-nearest neighbor (KNN)](3_k_nearest_neighbor/README.md)
4. [K-means](4_k_means/README.md)
5. [support vector machine (SVM)](5_support_vector_machine/README.md)
6. [kernel-based SVM](6_kernel_based_SVM/README.md)
7. [decision tree](7_decision_tree/README.md)
8. [artificial neural network](8_artificial_neural_network/README.md)
9. [RNN LSTM Transformer](9_RNN_LSTM_Transformer/README.md)
10. [CNN GNN](10_CNN_GNN/README.md) convolutional neural network & graph neural network

There are other machine learning algorithms at neural network level 
which will be included in the future.
Algorithms include but not limit to recurrent neural network, variational autoencoder (VAE),
encoder, decoder, transformer, generative adversarial network, etc.
